# Countdown-Anagram-Solver
A Python script that solves anagrams, and gives you the word worth the most points.

# What does it do?
You pass in 9 random letters, as an argument, and the script will search through a dictionary containing over 180,000 words. Once the script has chosen a word it will search the Merriam Webster dictionary for the word to ensure it is viable.

# How to use?
The script is extremely simple to use. All you need to do is download Python, and also install requests through pip. (This is how the script checks the Merriam Webster dictionary). Once those steps are done just open up a Terminal and type:
`python solver.py [9_random_letters]`

A realistic example would look like:
`python solver.py oesainghe`

The script will then tell you the largest word you can make with those letters. In the case above, the script tells me the biggest word would be 'agonies'.
